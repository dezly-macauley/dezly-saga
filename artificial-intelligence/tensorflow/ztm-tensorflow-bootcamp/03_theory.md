What is machine learning?
Turning data into numbers and finding patterns in those numbers

A tensor is a numerical encoding of data.
Basically it is data converted to a format that can be used by 
algorithm can use.

Input -> Numerical encoding -> neural network -> Output

## Tensorflow Workflow
1. Get data ready (turn into Tensors) 
2. Build or pick a pre-trained model (to suit your problem): Tensorflow Hub
3. Fit the model to the data and make a predication
4. Evaluate the model
5. Improve through experiementation
6. Save and reload your trained model
