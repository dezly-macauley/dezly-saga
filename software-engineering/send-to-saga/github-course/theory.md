### Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)

This is made up of a `server` and a `client`

The server contains the the main repository that has the full history of the 
code base.

A developer who is working on the project is the `client`, need to `pull` 
the code from the server to their local machine. 

In simple terms, the developer downloads a copy of the code from the server,
and gets their own copy to work on.

After making changes to their own copy of the code. The `developer` pushes
it up to github so that other developer's can see the code.

You need to be connected to the server to perform ANY actions.

### Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)

You still need to pull down code from the server to view the latest changes.

The difference is this. Every user, is essentially a server and not a client.

This means that everytime you pull down code from the DVCS, you have the 
entire history of changes on your local system.

You don't need to be connected to the server to add your changes or view a 
file's history.

You only need to be connected to the server to push your own changes, or pull
down the lastest changes from the repo in the cloud.
