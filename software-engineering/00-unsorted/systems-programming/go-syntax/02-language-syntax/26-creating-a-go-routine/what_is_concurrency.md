# What is Concurrency?

- Allows multiple parts of a program to start, run, and complete
simultatneously
- Construct streaming data pipelines
- Make efficient use of I/O and multiple CPUs
- Allows complex systems with multiple components
- Raises the efficiency of the program

# What is the difference between Concurrency and Parallelism

Concurrency is not Parallelism.

Concurrency deals with many things at onces

Parallelism does many things at the same time

Concurrency enables parallelism by designing a correct structure 
of concurrency work

So in short:

Concurrency is about structure.
Making the program concurrent in a better way, by breaking them down into
smaller pieces of work.

Parallelism is about execution.
And then Go's scheduler will try to make them parallel if its possible and 
allowed

# Communicating Sequencial Processes (CSP) vs actor based concurrency

The actor model is present in programming langauges like Erlang and Scala

Go uses the CSP model
