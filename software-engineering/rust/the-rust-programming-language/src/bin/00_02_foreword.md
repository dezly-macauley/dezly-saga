# Foreword
_______________________________________________________________________________
Why Rust appeals to me:
1. I want to become proficient at low-level systems programming.
2. I want a language that is strongly-typed and has a compiler that checks
for classical errors that could lead to memory leaks, crashes, 
and potential security issues.
3. I want to be able to optimize my code and write programs that make use
of asynchronous programming.
