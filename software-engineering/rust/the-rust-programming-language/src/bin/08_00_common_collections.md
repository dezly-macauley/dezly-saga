# Common Collections
_______________________________________________________________________________
1. These are data structures that are part of the Rust standard library
2. `Collections` are data structures that can contain multiple values.
3. `Collections` are stored on the heap (also refered to as heap allocated)
because the size of a collection is not known at compile time.
4. `Collections` can grow and shrink as the program runs.

## Examples

- Vectors: Allows you to store an undefined number of values 
next to each other.
- String: A collection of characters.
- Hash map: Allows you to store data in key-value pairs.
