## Pass by Value

In Go function calls are "pass by value"

This means that when you pass an arguement into a function, that function
receives a copy of what you passed in. The value of the original variable
is NOT changed.

## Pointers

A pointer is a variable that points to a memory address.

To access the data stored at that memory address,
you would need to do something called "deferencing the pointer".

## Pass by reference

This is when you give a function a pointer as an arguement. 
In this case the value of the original variable IS changed.
