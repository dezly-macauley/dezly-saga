### Descriminative models - Used for classification in machine learning
They are often called classifiers because they are used to distinish between
classes.

E.g. They evaluate certain features and then use that to classify what
something is.

E.g. Given that this animal has `slit eyes`, `fur` and `a tail`, >>
it probably falls into the `cat class`.

Generative models - How to make a realistic representation of a class

E.g. A realistic picture of a dog.

Noise = A random set of values going into the generative model.
This is to ensure that the AI does no generate the same dog each time.
