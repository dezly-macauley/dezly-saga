# PostgreSQL Guide
_______________________________________________________________________________

### How to check what version of PostgreSQL you have installed:

```
postgres --version
```

You'll get an output that looks like this

```
postgres (PostgreSQL) 15.8
```

_______________________________________________________________________________

### How to connect to the default database as a superuser

```
psql -U "postgres" -d "postgres""
```

The will connect using a default user called "postgresql" and a default 
database called "postgres".

Your prompt will now look like this:

```
postgres=#
```

Run this command once after connecting to the database:
```
\x auto
```

To neaten up the prompt after running commands,
just press `Ctrl and l`

To exit:

```
\q
```
_______________________________________________________________________________

## The rest of these commands need to be run from the PostgreSQL prompt

_______________________________________________________________________________

### View a list of available database

```
\l
```

By default, you should see three databases: 
postgres, template0, and template1

These databases are owned by postgres and it's generally a bad idea to 
delete them, because this could cause PostgreSQL to start behaving 
in unexpected ways.

_______________________________________________________________________________

### To display users

```
\du
```
_______________________________________________________________________________

### How to Create a user

Login as the "postgres" user:
```
psql -U "postgres"
```

Create another user:
```
CREATE USER "dezly-macauley WITH LOGIN CREATEDB";
```

"dezly-macauley" is a user with the permission to login and create databases

_______________________________________________________________________________

### How to set a password for a User or change that password

While logged in as the postgres user do this:

```
ALTER USER "dezly-macauley" WITH PASSWORD 'the-password-you-want';
```

> Note: Use double quotes for identifies, and single qoutes for strings.

_______________________________________________________________________________

### How to give a user permission to create databases

```
ALTER ROLE "dezly-macauley" WITH CREATEDB;
```
_______________________________________________________________________________

### Create a database

I have a database file called "demo" so I will create a
database with the same name, that is owned by the user dezly-macauley.

```
CREATE DATABASE "demo" WITH OWNER "dezly-macauley";
```

_______________________________________________________________________________

### How to enter the psql cli as a specific user 
### and connect to a specific database

First exit psql

```
\q
```

```
psql -U "dezly-macauley" -d "demo";
```

Your prompt should look like this now:

```
demo=>
```

To confirm that you are connected to the correct database 
and the correct user, use this command:

```
\conninfo
```
_______________________________________________________________________________

### How to import data from a file into PostgreSQL

First create a database for the file that you want to import.

E.g. If the file is called "demo", then you could just create a database with
the same name.

```
CREATE DATABASE "demo" WITH OWNER "dezly-macauley";
```

_______________________________________________________________________________

The next thing you need to do is to logout of the PostgreSQL prompt:

```
\q
```

Then make sure that you are in the directory that contains the file:
Then run this command:
```
psql -d demo -U your_username -f file-path/name_of_file.sql
```

E.g. 

psql -d "demo" -U "dezly-macauley" -f ./demo.sql

_______________________________________________________________________________

## Connect to a database first before running the following commands

```
psql -U "dezly-macauley" -d "demo";
```

Your prompt should look like this now:

```
demo=>
```

### How to display all of the tables in the current database

```
\dt
```

### To view how large each table is:

```
\dt+
```

_______________________________________________________________________________

### How to view what columns a specific table has

```
\d users
```
_______________________________________________________________________________

### How to view data from a specific table

This will select all columns from the table called "users",
and display only the first 10 rows of data.
```
select * from "users" limit 10;
```

You can select specific columns
```
select id, first_name, last_name from "users" limit 5;
```

_______________________________________________________________________________

### How to create a table from scratch

While logged in as a user and connected to a database, run this command:

```
CREATE TABLE users(name VARCHAR(128), email VARCHAR(128));
```

This is known as the schema of the database. 
This table called "users", it has two columns, 
and each of those columns can hold up to 128 characters of text.


In PostgreSQL a database can have multiple schema

Inside each schema are the tables 

_______________________________________________________________________________

### How to view the schema of a table

```
\d+ name-of-table
```
