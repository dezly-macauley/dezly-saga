## Cybersecurity
The practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
information, networks, and devices from unathorized access and manipulation.

It also involves making sure that legal compliance standards are being met,
so that an organisation does not get fined.

Another aspect is to reduce the expenses that would happen in the case of
a data loss, or operational downtime. 

All of this ensures that customers maintain trust in a brand.
