A "shebang" is a special line at the top of a script that 
tells your shell which program to use to execute the file.

The format of a shebang is:

#! the-location-of-the-interpreter-that-will-run-the-script 

This is a shebang 

For example this tells the interpreter to run the script using python3 
#!/usr/bin/python3

For example this tells the interpreter to run the script using 
the shell command
#!/usr/bin/sh
